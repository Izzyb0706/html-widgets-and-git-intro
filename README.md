### **Basic Git Concepts**

1.  **Repository (Repo)**
    A project folder that Git is tracking. Can be
    **local** (on your computer) or
    **remote** (Like GitHub)
2.  **Version Control**
    A stystem that tracks changes to code
    over times, letting you revert to previous versions or collaborate with
    others.
3.  **Commit**
    A snapshot of your changes. Includes a
    message describing what changed.
4.  **Working Directory**
    The current state of your files on
    disk.
5.  **Staging Area**
    Where you prepare changes before
    committing. You "stage" files that are
    ready to be committed
